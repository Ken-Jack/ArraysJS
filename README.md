# ArraysJS
A lot of what i do with JavaScript involves manipulating arrays. I wrote this library, to make my life easier by extending the 
JavaScript Array prototype. It worked! I hope it makes your life easier too.

ArraysJS is a group of Array Extension Functions that augment the ones provided by Javascript. An advantage of this approach, is the ability 
to chain function calls, to achieve what you want.

Use with creativity, and it will serve you well ... Holla, if you think of something that should be there. I'd be quite willing to add to 
and remove functions.
